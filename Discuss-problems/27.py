# Simple LL Traversal question and another LL question Delete Nth node from end of the list, 
# this was my only question because I described multiple approaches and he had some follow ups.


# Interview 1: Deep Copy stuff and pretty challenging follow ups, it isn't enough to go thru the 
# tagged questions and know one solution, make sure you know all solutions as well as think about 
# follow ups they may ask such as how a change in the input data structure could affect your 
# solution.

# Interview 2: Simpler questions but still had to dicuss multiple approaches. Simple question 
# involving creating a graph and then seeing if there was a path from A -> B. Second question 
# was a dp problem involving coins.
