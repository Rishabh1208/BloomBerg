# Coding - LC Hard:
# https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ships-in-a-rectangle/
# Follow up -

# Optimize time complexity from O(mn) [Before I started coding].
# Base of the logarithmic time complexity of the code.
# If call is made 1million times, what changes in the existing algorithm must be implemented to 
# accomodate this?
# Recieved feedback within 48hrs to proceed to the next round (System Design).
# I wanted to know if there are any particular things I should be focusing on for this round as 
# I am a fresher and dont have much idea regarding System Design. Any help is appreciated.
# Thanks!
