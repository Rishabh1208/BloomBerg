# First 10 mins was basically introductions (the interviewer made me talk about myself and my projects
# for quite a bit lol)

# Then we dove into the technical question which was pretty much the same thing as: Knight Dailer
# https://leetcode.com/problems/knight-dialer/

# I was a dumbass during the interview cuz I was freaking over the time I had left. Anyways, the
# interviewer said I have 20-25 mins to code up a solution and the rest of the time would be for any
# quesitons I have. I did not have to run my code and this was the only question I had to solve

# I did not solve the question optimally because of this and tbh I'm not expecting to hear back but
# I hope this helps anyone who has their upcoming Bloomberg Interview. I will update the post if I
# hear back for next steps lol
