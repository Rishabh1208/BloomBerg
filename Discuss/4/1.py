# The question was :
# https://leetcode.com/problems/design-an-ordered-stream/

# Asked me to not use vector and then many follow ups. Asked me to not copy the variable, did not 
# understand what he meant by this until he told to pass by reference.
# I performed okayish I guess, could solve the question using hashmaps as we dont have a fixed 
# number of streams coming in.
# I would say, prepare OOD very nicely, even if you know how to solve the question, the way you
# solve matters.
# Waiting for the results, interviewer told me I will get it within 5days if I passed the phone 
# screen or not.
