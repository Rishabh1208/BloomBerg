# Question was basically valid parantheses question in leetcode which followed by some 
# follow-ups like "what happens if I want to invent some custom parantheses like "<>"?". 
# I implemented hashmap for different paranthesis types using std::map.

# After that other enginner asked me some questions about time complexity of std::map and 
# std::unordered_map in C++.I answered them for std::map as it is a binary search tree basically,
# but choked on describing how unordered_map has O(1) time complexity.Interviewee wanted me to 
# describe how it is O(1) and what is hashing? but I couldn't properly.I just feel like I will 
# be rejected because of this even though I answered all questions nicely before this :(
