# Round 1 -> Collatz Conjecture question from https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/1504782/bloomberg-phone-interview-1042021-collatz-conjecture-rejection
# I figured out the first portion, with the even/odd/while loop. 
# She was super sweet and talked to me about optimizing it. 
# I guessed storing intermediate values in a map but 
# forgot the actual word for it (it's memoization). 
# I implemented it but had a few errors here and there and 
# she talked me through it and I eventually implemented it.
