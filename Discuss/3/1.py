# I had one question:

#  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
#  [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
#  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
#  [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]]
# You need to find a number of lakes, so 0 which are surrounded with 1, if it touches the border, 
# than it is not a lake, it is similar to number of islands . The whole interview is around 45 - 60 min. 
# You have last15 min to ask questions.


# I have received these questions, however, they change them slightly, 
# so double linked list did not have this.prev
