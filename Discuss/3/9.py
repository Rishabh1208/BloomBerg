# It was basically https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/ but max instead of min.
# At first I tried the normal way, using max() on the max method, then got asked about 
# the efficiency and how to improve it. I then created another list to keep tracking of 
# max values (2nd approach).

# He then asked about the time complexity and space complexity of the code.
