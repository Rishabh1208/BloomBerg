# Interviewer introduce himself
# Me introduce myself
# a. project you are proud of & why
# b. why Bloomberg
# Coding problem:
# Given two string, how to tell if they are anagram? (https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)
# I wrote my solution in C.
# * Follow up questions:
# a. What is the runtime & space complexity?
# b. What if the element are not just alphabet, but could be anything (number, Korean letter, emoji..)?
# --> Using high-level language: Hash table
# c. Modify the current code to output how many characters you need to change in order to make the two string anagram?
# d. Runtime & space complexity?
# Me asking him questions about Bloomberg
# The interviewer is very friendly and chatty. Even if I didn't understand his questions sometimes, he didn't make me feel stupid.
# It is a collaborative process and we optimised my solution together
