# I recently had an onsite interview with Bloomberg with two of their employees.
# One of them asked https: // leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/,
# I clarified some points like what characters are being used(ASCII/Non-ASCII, maximum length of string to
# decide the type of data structure)
# and then coded the solution. I tested it on corner cases found some bugs, fixed it and we were done.
# I tried my best to communicate my thought process like why I used hash-map and not an array(saving space).

# Then the second guy asked, the underground subway problem
# https: // leetcode.com/problems/design-underground-system/
# which I solved using two hash maps. First the average time API
# took O(N) time then I avoided the repition in computation and
# reduced the time to O(1). Both were happy.

# My internship project at some other firm were also coinciding with
# what they were working on and I showed interest in it and did
# discussion with them. Now, one thing that I am not able to
# understand is that if everything was good(except network connectivity, may
#                                           be my voice wasn't clear or something).

# Feeling weird and confused after this rejection.
