# The interviewer started with explaining the structure of the interview and went on to introduce himself and what his role is in the company. He then asked me to introduce myself.

# Then we moved on to coding, he wrote out a question scenario for me. The coding problem was to implement my own class for a web browswer history, it should be able to keep track of all the websites the user has visited and the user should be able to go back. In the case of visiting a website that is already in your history, the website needs to be removed from the history. so, if the user visits the following websites;

# google.com, udemy.com, facebook.com, google.com.

# The output should be;

# udemy.com, facebook.com, google.com.

# I started explaining what went through my head as he was explaining the problem and that initially I had a stack in mind, but when he mentioned that duplicates need to be removed, I realised that implemention will struggle. I then explained how using a singlylinked list would be perfect and I would have a dictionary that would store the url as key and the nodes as the value for unique addresses.

# Once I got to the implementation of my DeleteDuplicate() method, I realised that deleting a node from the middle of my singly linked list would either have to result in O(n) time or simply impossible. I had access to the pointer thanks to my dictionary, but needed to change my implementation to a doubly linked list. He was very through the whole way as I was very clear with my communication and approach to each method/implementation.

# He then asked me a few questions regarding the same problem once we had stopped coding, he just wanted to see how I would approach it and not code it. He asked;

# How would you implement a bookmark feature?
# What about if the user wants to delete history or a specific history?
# What other features could the user want? (This was very vague and I said certain stuff, but he kept wanting it to be linked with the history).

# He asked me the typical time complexity question. Overall, he was very impressed and said I came up with a very optimal solution.

# Lastly, He opened the floor for any questions that I had, I asked him the following;

# What is the culture like in bloomberg?
# Do you guys have training budgets for individuals to use for individual studies/conferences?
# Do you have mentorship schemes within bloomberg?
# What project are you currently working on and what are you guys hoping to achieve with it?
# Lastly, If you were my mentor, after seeing how I performed in this interview, what improvements would you suggest?
# Overall, he was very impressed with the whole interview and the time flew before I knew it. Waiting to hear back.

# **For anyone that has their interviews coming up, be confident and try to communicate as much as you can. They really are there to help you, don't be scared. AND USE *!!!!!!
