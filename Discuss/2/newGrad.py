# System Design
# The question was to design a Bloomberg Terminal feature for retrieving top K viewed news
# articles by users for a predefined time period. Let's say getTopK(K, timeframe).
# We have millions of news that can be read by users, the K can be relatively large.
# I reviewed a lot of system design material beforehand and one of the videos I watched
# was how to design a system for Top K heavy hitters. I proposed a system as in this video
# that I watched a few days before the interview but still got rejected.
