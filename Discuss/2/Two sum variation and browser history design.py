# Variation of two sum: Given two arrays A, B and a target v, 
# find out two elements a and b (one from A and another from B) so that a+b = v
# A = [1,4,6,7]
# B = [4,7,3,2]
# target = 9

#hashMap_A = { 1: 8, 4: 5, 6: 3, 7: 2}
# set_B = {4,7,3,2}
# for key, value in hashMap_A.items():
#     if value in set_B:
#         return [key,value]
