// I have over 3 years of work experience as a software engineer.
// I was working as a Full-Stack developer at Guardian Life Insurance where I have contributed to multiple projects.

// Apart from work, I love fitness training and hiking.

// Tell me about your experience | Tell me about your projects.
// I have worked on many important projects in my career.
// There is one project where we have to revamp the old UI screens that was built on old java into new responsive screen using react.js that improved page load time 
// by 3-4 second.
// and there is one more project where we have to create a graphQL wrapper around multiple REST and SOAP API's that improved the overall performance 
// of the application 80%.
// we use agile methology in our team where we collaborated with our product owner and business analyst to divide the feature into small tasks so that every developer
// can work on the different tasks independently. Also we use 2 weeks sprint where some task has been allocated to every developer and it has to be completed within
// those 2 weeks and after every certain point of time, we need to deploy the features into production.

// 1) why do you want to work at Hubspot?

// So what excites me the most about Hubspot is the company's unique culture.
// HubSpot Gives their Employees The Flexibility And Tools To Succeed. And
// I understand from people working at Hubspot is, that its environment is highly

// to work hard and give their best.

// HEART: Humble, Empathetic(empethetic), Adaptable, Remarkable, and Transparent.
// focus more on the impact and results of their work, rather than the where and when.
// Talented diverse and humble people.

// 2) Conflict at work?

// Situation: So In my previous company, my SCRUM master schedules a lot of meetings.
//            And I was required to attend all of them but sometimes had little to contribute in some of the meetings.
// Task:      I understood that my SCRUM master wanted to keep me up-to-date, but the meetings left me very little time for me to work,
//            forcing me to either work long weekends or risk missing a deadline.
// Action:    So I scheduled a meeting with my SCRUM master to talk about the problem I was facing and how it was imapcting my work.
//            He empathized with me and agreed to share meeting agendas and let me decide whether to attend a meeting or not. In turn,
//            I promised to read all minutes of meetings for any meetings I missed.
// Result:    And as a result of this my Communication with my SCRUM master got opened,
//            and we were able to put this knowledge to use in our subsequent projects.

// 3) Describe a time you failed and how you handled that situation? / How did you act when you fail?

// Situation: I was managing a project for one of our biggest clients in my previous to previous company, and I was so anxious to please them that
//            told them I could finish the project within 2 weeks. I thought it was doable, but it ended up taking three weeks
//            and they were not happy with it.
//            The extra week was necessary since I ran into trouble and decided to focus on the client's long-term success rather than a quick remedy.
//            Looking back, I realized I should have been more conservative in my estimate to the client.
// Action:    I realized that a client isn’t going to be upset if I am  clear about the timeline in advance, but they are going to
//            be disappointed if I promise something and then don’t deliver it.
// Result:    So I took this experience and used it to become much better at managing the expectations of clients during projects
//            I oversee. For example, on the next project with a different client, I told them it’d take four weeks and I finished in
//            three. They were very happy about this.

// 4) Project which you're most proud of ? | Tell me about a success you're particularly proud of in your career and why it was a success.
// At Meta, I was assigned a task to generate a summary section from the graph table. 
// There might be more than 20,00 deeply nested row and it is hard to find for out clients which module or dependencies caused the 
// regression. So my task is to list down the top 3 dependencies that caused the most regression. Our Team focuses on managing the code 
// size and give metrics on performance, reliability and efficiency across meta family of app’s.
// I designed an algorithm where I have to traverse a graph table using depth first search.keeping in mind some of the edges cases like 
// graph could be cyclic and that might lead to infinite loop. Also I made the UI interactive and appealing.
// As a result of the summary section, the support ticket got reduced by more than 60%. And also I have received some good feedback about 
// it from our clients.

// Tell me something you had to learn very quickly but knew nothing about before.
// Situation:  So in previous company, our team had a to implement a feature using a new technology, that we haven't worked on.
// Task: Our Tech manager had choosen me implement it. and since this feature had to go live soon, I had very little time to implmenet it.
// Action: I started learning about the new technology from the official documentation and some video tutorials.
// And I started implementing it. I faced a lot of difficulties while implementing it as it was totally new to me.
// Sometimes, I had to extend my working hours to get the work done, but it was fun at the same time because I was learning something new.
// Also I had to create a technical documentation about this feature so that it would be helpful for all the developers working in different
// teams. And As I was owing the feature so I really want to make it work.
// Result: Finally the feature got completed within the deadline and went live onto production with flying colors.
// My tech manager appreciated my efforts and Thank me to take the ownership of the whole feature. And also told me to setup
// a meeting with developers of other team to tranfer the knowledge to them so that they could also implement it.

// 5) Describe a mentor who has impacted you in a positive way? | How a mentor impacted you?
// so when I was in my undergrad

// Whenever my advisor sent an opportunity my way, I would take it and try to make the best out of it.
// Since I knew that her career had been very similar to what I wanted to go into, I fully trusted her and
// the opportunities that she brought to the table. With the help of my advisor’s recommendations,

//            written was hard to understand. and because of that the task got delayed.

// Task:      We were in the hyper-growth phase of a company project, so each member had to do finish the task within the allocated time.

// Action:    So, We got together to address the issues.
//            I explained the UI issues to him and showed him on the screen that it's not completely matching the design which was given.
//            I also asked him to be completely transparent with me and let me know where he was facing the issues so that I could help him.
//            He expressed that he was not good in writing the css and was struggling in that.
//            I showed him how to fix the issues and what all best practices he could follow while doing the coding. Also I shared some
//            refernces with him so that he can learn whenever he got some time.
//            I also encouraged him to collaborate with other members if he was struggling with something.

//             He was not habitual of daily meetings and also struggling with his task. I offered the proper support and shared some of the resources that could
