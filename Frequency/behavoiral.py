# difficult project, why it was difficult and how did you solve it?

# generate a human readable summary section from the code dependency graph table that helps 
# our users to find the root cause of the regression more easily.

# Requirement was very vague there is no clear cut requirement, so I scheluded a meeting with
# some of the clients (our clients are developers of Meta) to understand their requirement and 
# whether this new feature that is human readble summary section would be helpful to them and
# If they need any additional information in the summary section which might be helpful for them.
# I jotted down some requirements and discussed with my manager.

# dependency which got added, removed, or module size change or tier size change.

#once the requiremnet got finalized, I started implementing the algorithm.
# I came up with two different approaches, BFS and DFS, I choose DFS beacuse I need to find the root cause of the regression that means
# I need to go deep down in the graph table to find the dependency. Since the graph table could have cycles, I also take care of that in my algorithm.

# I was able to complete the task on time and also was able to ship the code to production.
# Got some really good feedback from our clients and also it reduces the support ticket by more than 60%.
