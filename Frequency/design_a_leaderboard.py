# ...............................................................................

# O(logN) for addScore. This is because each addition to the BST takes a logarithmic time for search.
# The addition itself once the location of the parent is known, takes constant time.

# O(logN) for reset since we need to search for the score in the BST and then update/remove it.
# Note that this complexity is in the case when every player always maintains a unique score.

# It takes O(K) for our top function since we simply iterate over the keys of the TreeMap and
# stop once we're done considering K scores.
# Note that if the data structure doesn't provide a natural
# iterator, then we can simply get a list of all the key-value pairs and they will naturally be sorted
# due to the nature of this data structure. In that case, the complexity would be O(N)O(N) since we
# would be forming a new list.

# SortedDict --> internally uses Balanced Binary search Tree which has add/remove/update in logn time.
