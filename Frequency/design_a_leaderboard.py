# Note that this complexity is in the case when every player always maintains a unique score.
# It takes O(K)O(K) for our top function since we simply iterate over the keys of the TreeMap and 
# stop once we're done considering K scores. Note that if the data structure doesn't provide a natural 
# iterator, then we can simply get a list of all the key-value pairs and they will naturally be sorted 
# due to the nature of this data structure. In that case, the complexity would be O(N)O(N) since we
