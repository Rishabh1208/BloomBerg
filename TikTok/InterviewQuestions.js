// 1) Two Sum
// 2) traverse a binary tree
// 3) Queens puzzle
// 4) Describe the most significant project on your resume.
// 5) Leetcode Medium Design problem
// 6) Coding: merge two binary search trees to build one BST. (inorder traversal + sorted array merge + build a new tree from inorder array)
// 7) ask reverse question.
// 8) 2 leetcode questions about sort and array
// 9) One medium LC question each round, Questions about past projects (scale, tech used etc, Questions about the tech used in the past projects(DB, Redis etc)
// 10) Tree Data Structure, Binary Search Tree to Double Linked List
// 11) paint the graph using any algo
// 12) container with most water
// 13) echnical 1: Medium graph then hard follow-up
// Technical 2: Medium geometric (basic geometry though), then questions related to the team I would be on
// HM: Medium tree, interviewer indicated there would be followup but ran out of time doing the first medium
// 14) All the coding questions asked were available on leetcode. It would be unfair to expose the exact questions, so summarising the topics covered in each round.
// Round 1 : Trees and Math problem. Medium difficulty ones in leetcode.
// Round 2 : System design + projects worked on so far.
// Questions on distributed systems, best practices, unit and integration testing, transaction management and questions on some of the common problems faced in a distributed environment. Some of these questions are abstract and open ended. It helps if you can give examples and answer.
// Round 3: Culture fit questions designing some features of a real world system like twitter, databases and designing a cache with some special features. We had to write a pseudo code.
// 15) Create and navigate a binary tree: only explore the right side of the tree
// 16) https://leetcode.com/problems/split-a-string-into-the-max-number-of-unique-substrings/
// 17) Letter combinations of phone number, Regex pattern question
// 18) Graph question related to bipartite graphs
// 19) hard DFS and DP question.
